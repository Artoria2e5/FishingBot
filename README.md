Minecraft 1.14 AFK Fishing bot
==============

This is a small Minecraft 1.14 Client which is able to automatically fish.

### How to use?
1. Download a [release](https://github.com/MrKinau/FishingBot/releases) (or build it at you own)
2. Start the Client (java -jar Fishingbot.jar)
3. Fill in the configs, which generated on the first start
4. Restart the bot (Remember to give the player a fishing rod)

### Credits
Thanks to [Torchbot](https://github.com/woder/TorchBot) for a code base. I've just stolen the half project lol.
